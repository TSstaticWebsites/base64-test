# Issue Summary - Base64 Test Application

## Current Problems

### 1. yEnc Chunk Count Issue
**Status**: Fixed

**Problem**: yEnc encoding shows the same number of chunks (155) as Base64, even though it should have fewer chunks due to lower overhead.

**Root Cause**: The `/file/{file_id}/info` endpoint returned **estimates** or encoding-agnostic cached values rather than checking whether the file had actually been processed with the requested encoding.

**Expected Behavior**:
- Base64: ~159 chunks for 120MB file (1.33x overhead)
- yEnc: ~122 chunks for 120MB file (1.02x overhead)
- Hex: ~240 chunks for 120MB file (2.00x overhead)

**Smart Chunking IS Working**: The backend correctly calculates different binary read sizes:
```
base64     reads   788,403 bytes -> produces 1MB encoded
hex        reads   524,288 bytes -> produces 1MB encoded  
yenc       reads 1,028,015 bytes -> produces 1MB encoded
```

### 2. Performance Feels Slower
**Problem**: Initial requests feel slower after container restarts.

**Root Cause**: The backend stores file metadata in memory (`processed_files` dict). When the container restarts, this state is lost, requiring:
1. Re-scanning files from disk (adds ~8-10 seconds)
2. Re-processing on first chunk request (adds ~2-3 seconds)

## The Fix

The `/file/{file_id}/info` endpoint now:
1. Detects whether the requested encoding has been processed by checking the encoding-specific cache directory.
2. Returns the actual chunk count by counting cached chunk files for that encoding.
3. Falls back to estimates only if that encoding has not been processed yet.
4. Reports `is_processed` relative to the requested encoding.

## Quick Test to Verify

```bash
# Request a yEnc chunk to trigger processing
curl "http://localhost/api/chunk/738e2f999860553d/0?encoding=yenc"

# Check what was actually created
docker exec base64-test-backend-1 sh -c "ls /app/cache/738e2f999860553d_yenc/ | wc -l"
# Should show ~122 files for yEnc

# The info endpoint now returns the actual (~122) chunk count
curl "http://localhost/api/file/738e2f999860553d/info?encoding=yenc"
```
